## Groundwork For Text Editor and Shell

You are an intern at Macrohard, where you'll be writing a text editor and shell for everyone on your team.

These projects will take you several weeks, and your mentor has decided on the following timetable:

*   Week A: Vector and Sstream 
*   Week B: Text Editor
*   Week C: Shell

The _Text Editor_ will use a [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) that another intern has written. Your mentor has decided to create a library to make dealing with strings in C easier.

The _Shell_ is a terminal. Like all good terminals, your shell will need to remember what processes are running. 

However, after hearing tales of your talent, and with vectors being all the rage, other team leads have asked for vectors that they can use in their own projects. One option would be to write a vector for each team. However, being a good programmer, you know that code duplication is bad. Also, you're a lazy programmer, so you want to write as little code as possible to accomplish everything. You decide to implement a generic vector, something that every team can use with minimal changes.


## Vector

A vector is an array that grows as a user adds and removes items from it. (Since CS 225 was a prerequisite, you probably knew all of that already.) However, your vector will need to be feature-rich enough for someone to easily create a document from it, or anything else the other sneaky teams want for their projects.

Your implementation should go in `vector.c`, which is the only file that will be sent to your team lead for review. As an intern looking to become a full-time employee, you should create test cases in `vector_test.c` to show you are a responsible programmer. Your mentor has left notes in `vector.h` guiding your implementation.

In case a fellow employee asks what you learned in CS 225, here's some review:

* [Lectures](https://web.archive.org/web/20151225075250/https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/cs225/lectures/)
* [Array Resizing](https://web.archive.org/web/20160119032015/https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/cs225/lectures/slides/lec0928-resizing.pdf)
* [Lecture Recording](https://recordings.engineering.illinois.edu:8443/ess/echo/presentation/a73d58c6-98a0-4a8c-bf68-f0fb224f5c26)

Since this vector is generic, it will have to call custom constructor, destructor, and default constructor functions when objects are added or removed. (How is this better than a single function which handles all possible types?) Thus, your vector structure will contain pointers to your constructor or destructor routines, and you can initialize the vector by passing pointers to these functions as parameters.

<!--Here's an illustration:

What you'll end up with is a useful general-purpose vector, capable of dynamically expanding. (No more fixed-sized buffers!)

Note: Remember that vector size (the number of actual objects held in the vector) and capacity (size of the storage space currently allocated for the vector) are two different things. Refer to documentation in vector.h and vector.c for more information.

## sstring

SString is a wrapper around c strings which makes dealing with strings easier
with higher level functions. We have not specified the definition of the sstring
struct, and left that up to you! Below are some brief descriptions of what each
function should do.

### `sstring *cstr_to_sstring(char *input)`

This function should take in a c-string and return a pointer to a sstring on the
heap.

### `char *sstring_to_cstr(sstring *this)`

This function should take in a sstring an return a pointer to a c-string on the
heap.

### `int sstring_append(sstring *this, sstring *addition)`

This function should take in two sstrings, append the second to the first, and
return the length of the first sstring after the append.

### `vector *sstring_split(sstring *this, char delimiter)`

This function should take an sstring and a character and split the sstring into
a vector of c-strings on the delimiter.
(e.g. `sstring_split(cstr_to_sstring("abcdeefg"), 'e') == [ "abcd", "", "fg" ]`)

### `int sstring_substitute(sstring *this, size_t offset, char *target, char *substitution)`

This function should substitute one occurrence of `target` in `this` after
`offset` bytes with `substitution`. If there are no occurrences of `target` after
`offset` bytes, return `-1`.  Otherwise return `0`.

### `char *sstring_slice(sstring *this, int start, int end)`

This function takes in a sstring, a start index and an end index. Return a
c-string representing the bytes between start (inclusive) and end (exclusive).

### `void sstring_destroy(sstring *this)`

This function cleans up any allocated memory for a sstring.



## Managing memory

Remember, `man` is man's best friend. Since you're working with dynamic memory, there are quite a few functions you should be familiar with before you proceed. `malloc()`, `free()`, `realloc()`,  `calloc()`, `memmove()` are your friends; don't shy away!

* `man 3 malloc`
* `man 3 free`
* ...there's a pattern here

## Undefined behavior

_Undefined behavior_ is a scenario or edge case for which there is no documentation describing how the code should react. For example, man pages do not describe what happens when you feed `NULL` into `strcmp()`. Your mentor will not answer questions like "What if my user wants an element past the end of the vector?", because that is undefined behavior.

So, for the entirety of this MP, you should use `assert()` statements to check that your user is passing valid input to your function before operating on the input. For example, if you were implementing `strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2)`, then your code might look like this:

```C
#include <assert.h>

strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2) {
    assert(s1 != NULL && s2 != NULL);
    // Compare the two strings
    .
    .
    .
    return rv;
}
```

## Writing test cases

Just to emphasize how important test cases are, this lab spec will repeat itself and remind you that as good programmers, you are expected to write your own test cases for sstring and vector.
